## About

### Why did I make this project?
I built this project to create an application that connects to an sql database and allows a user to manage the database.

### What makes this app standout?
This project stands out because it pulls the titles and departments on request so the lists are always up to date.

## Installation
```npm i```

## Usage

This project will be used by someone who is looking to simply manage a small database of employees. This project will also be used as a learning tool for people looking for a node inquirer and mysql2 based employee tracker application for their homework.
